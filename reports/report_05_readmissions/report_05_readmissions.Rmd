# Main trial results for readmissions and complications

## Readmission for complications (from the main paper)

```{r}

# ITT sample

  data_itt <- data %>% filter(!is.na(primary_30d))


```


```{r}

  bind_rows(
    counts_pct("comp8wk", data), 
    total_units("ncomp8wk", data), 
    counts_pct("comp6m", data), 
    total_units("ncomp6m", data)
    ) %>% 
  bind_cols(data_frame(var = c("8w n(%)", "Total count", "6m n(%)", 
                               "Total count"))) %>%
  select(var, everything()) %>%
  kable(row.names = FALSE)

#*

```

This table matches the original manuscript (but only if I *don't* restrict to the ITT sample). 

```{r}

  m1 <- glm(comp8wk ~ group, data = data, 
            family = binomial(link = "log"), 
            start = c(-1, 0))
  
  m2 <- glm.nb(ncomp8wk ~ group + offset(log(os8wk)), data = data) 
  
  m3 <- glm(comp6m ~ group, data = data, 
              family = binomial(link = "log"), 
              start = c(-1, 0))
  
  m4 <- glm.nb(ncomp6m ~ group + offset(log(os6m)), data = data) 
  
```

The model results at 8 weeks were RR `r pull_ci(m1)` for any complications, and IRR `r pull_ci(m2)` for the number of complications. The model results at 6 months were `r pull_ci(m3)` for any complications, and `r pull_ci(m4)` for the number of complications. **NOTE**: This all matches, expect the final model result, which is just slightly off (regardless of whether I use the ITT sample or not). 


## Any readmissions (not previously reported)

```{r}

  bind_rows(
    counts_pct("readmission_8wk", data),                                                
    counts_pct("readmission_6mo", data),                                                
    ) %>% 
  bind_cols(data_frame(var = c("8w n(%)", "6m n(%)"))) %>%
  select(var, everything()) %>%
  kable(row.names = FALSE)

#*

```

```{r}

  m5 <- glm(readmission_8wk ~ group, data = data, 
            family = binomial(link = "log"), 
            start = c(-1, 0))
  

  m6 <- glm(readmission_6mo ~ group, data = data, 
              family = binomial(link = "log"), 
              start = c(-1, 0))
  
```

The model results were RR `r pull_ci(m5)` for any complications at 8weeks, and RR `r pull_ci(m6)` at 6 months.

How do readmission for complications compare to all readmissions?

8 weeks:

```{r}

  with(data, table(readmission_8wk, comp8wk))

```

6 months:

```{r}

  with(data, table(readmission_6mo, comp6m))

```

For both 8 weeks and 6 months, you get cases that are flagged as readmitted for complications but not for any readmission (`readmission` = No and `comp` = 1). 


## Postoperative grade 3+ complications (main paper)

```{r}

  counts_pct("post_op_comp3", data) %>%
  bind_cols(data_frame(var = c("CD grade III or above to discharge"))) %>%
  select(var, everything()) %>%
  kable(row.names = FALSE)

  m7 <- glm(post_op_comp3 ~ group, data = data, 
            family = binomial(link = "log"), 
            start = c(-1, 0))

```

The model result was `r pull_ci(m7)`. This all matches the main paper. 


## Postoperative worst grade complications (not previously reported)

```{r}

  counts_pct("post_op_comp", data) %>%
  bind_cols(data_frame(var = c("Worst grade, to discharge"))) %>%
  select(var, everything()) %>%
  kable(row.names = FALSE)

  m8 <- glm(post_op_comp ~ group, data = data, 
            family = binomial(link = "log"), 
            start = c(-1, 0))

```

The model result was `r pull_ci(m8)`. 

# Exploring readmissions

```{r}

# names(readm)
# map(readm, function(x)table(is.na(x)))
# length(unique(readm$identifier))

```

There are `r length(unique(readm$identifier))` unique patient identifiers in the readmission data set, which includes information on `r nrow(readm)` total readmissions. Among these, there were `r length(unique(readm$reason_for_admission))` reasons listed for readmission, indicating a need for thoughtful data cleaning. These were further categorized into `r length(unique(readm$classification))` groups in the readmission data.  

```{r}

  ggplot(readm, aes(x = group, fill = classification)) +
    geom_bar() +
    theme_minimal() +
    guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 1)) +
    theme(
      legend.key.size   = unit(0.1, 'cm'), 
      legend.key.height = unit(0.1, 'cm'), 
      legend.key.width  = unit(0.1, 'cm'), 
      legend.text = element_text(size = 12)
      ) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("Readmissions")


```

```{r}

```



The main dataset included `r table(data$readmission_8wk)["Yes"]` patients with a readmission by 8 weeks postop and `r table(data$readmission_6mo)`. If we count the number of unique patient identifiers in the readmissions dataset, filtering out those readmissions falling after the relevant time point, those figures were `r length(unique(readm$identifier[readm$days_pre_post_op <= 56]))` and `r length(unique(readm$identifier[readm$days_pre_post_op <= 180]))`, respectively (noting that this is before removing any of them based on their classification). 

Readmission time lines

```{r}

  readm %>%
    mutate(identifier = reorder(factor(identifier), surgery_date)) %>%
    select(identifier, surgery_date, admission_date, group) %>%
    gather(type, date, -identifier, -group) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = identifier, x = date, group = identifier, color = type)) +
    geom_line(size = 0.1, color = "grey") +
    geom_point() +
    scale_color_brewer("", palette = "Set1") +
    theme(
      axis.text.y = element_blank(), 
      axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), 
      panel.grid = element_blank()
      ) +
    facet_wrap(~group, ncol = 1) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("Patient")
  
          
```





## Confirming days alive and out of hospital

The median length of stay in each arm was ~ 9 days. Readmissions were substantially different, especially when looking at the actual number of days readmitted. There is a small concern that the existing calculation of the days alive and out of hospital doesnâ€™t seem to match up with the large observed difference in total days readmitted, so this needs to be closely checked. 

```{r}

  ggplot(data, aes(x = ncomp8wk, y = daoh)) +
    geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0.2)

```

```{r}

  ggplot(data, aes(x = ncomp6m, y = daoh)) +
    geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0.2)

```



## Optimal length of follow-up for days alive and out of hospital

There is some contention around how many days of follow-up would be best to truly capture the impact of the intervention on the outcome days alive and out of hospital. Candidates include 30, 45 and 90 days. We should conduct a sensitivity analysis where we look at this in more detail as a continuous function of follow-up time.
