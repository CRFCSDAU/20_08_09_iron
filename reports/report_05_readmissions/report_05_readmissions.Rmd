## Complications, readmissions and infection

Better characterization of complications, readmissions and infection
In a nutshell, there is a lot more information on these outcomes in the trial dataset that merits more detailed description. 

```{r}
names(data)[199:204]
```




## Confirming days alive and out of hospital
The median length of stay in each arm was ~ 9 days. Readmissions were substantially different, especially when looking at the actual number of days readmitted. There is a small concern that the existing calculation of the days alive and out of hospital doesnâ€™t seem to match up with the large observed difference in total days readmitted, so this needs to be closely checked. 

## Optimal length of follow-up for days alive and out of hospital

There is some contention around how many days of follow-up would be best to truly capture the impact of the intervention on the outcome days alive and out of hospital. Candidates include 30, 45 and 90 days. We should conduct a sensitivity analysis where we look at this in more detail as a continuous function of follow-up time.
